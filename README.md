## What is DBOS?

DBOS provides lightweight durable workflows built on top of Postgres.
Instead of managing your own workflow orchestrator or task queue system, you can use DBOS to add durable workflows and queues to your program in just a few lines of code.

To get started, follow the [quickstart](https://docs.dbos.dev/quickstart) to install this open-source library and connect it to a Postgres database.
Then, annotate workflows and steps in your program to make it durable!
That's all you need to do&mdash;there's no additional infrastructure for you to configure or manage.

## Features

<details open><summary><strong>üíæ Durable Workflows</strong></summary>

####

DBOS workflows make your program **durable** by checkpointing its state in Postgres.
If your program ever fails, when it restarts all your workflows will automatically resume from the last completed step.

You add durable workflows to your existing Python program by annotating workflows and steps:

```python
@DBOS.step()
def step_one():
    ...

@DBOS.step()
def step_two():
    ...

@DBOS.workflow()
def workflow()
    step_one()
    step_two()
```

Workflows are particularly useful for 

- Orchestrating complex business processes so they seamlessly recover from any failure.
- Processing incoming events (e.g. from Kafka) exactly once.
- Operating an AI agent or data pipeline, or anything that connects to an unreliable or non-deterministic API.

<details open><summary><strong>üì´ Durable Queues</strong></summary>

####

DBOS queues help you **durably** run tasks or workflows in the background.
You can enqueue a task as part of a durable workflow and one of your processes will pick it up for execution.
DBOS manages the execution of your task, guaranteeing that it gets completed (and that your workflow gets the result without having to resubmit the task) if your application is interrupted.

Queues also provide flow control, so you can limit the concurrency of your tasks on a per-queue or per-process basis.
You can also rate limit how often queued tasks are executed, deduplicate tasks, or prioritize critical tasks.

You can add queues to your workflows in just a couple lines of code.
They don't require a separate queueing service or message broker&mdash;just Postgres.

```python
from dbos import DBOS, Queue

queue = Queue("example_queue")

@DBOS.step()
def process_task(task):
  ...

@DBOS.workflow()
def process_tasks(tasks):
  task_handles = []
  # Enqueue each task so all tasks are processed concurrently.
  for task in tasks:
    handle = queue.enqueue(process_task, task)
    task_handles.append(handle)
  # Wait for each task to complete and retrieve its result.
  # Return the results of all tasks.
  return [handle.get_result() for handle in task_handles]
```
